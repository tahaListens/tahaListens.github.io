Personal page 
Hey yall, I am learning how to build a robust landing page as a Single Page App. 

I like Linktree, but wanted to set something up where I could customize it, need be. 

Bars for days, call me a barbarian
Coding for equality, call me an egalitarian. 


12/10/24 I set this page up.
1/25/25 I made it look more like a linktree.
